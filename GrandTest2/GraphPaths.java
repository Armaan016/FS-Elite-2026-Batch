// We have n cities and m roads. The n cities are numbered from 1 to n, and are unidirected. 
// We also have an integer p given. Now, we need to find all paths from city p to city n (p and n can be same).
// Now, there are streets that are common in all these paths. Find the number of such streets. If no such street exists, return -1.

// Example 1:
// Input: n = 4, m = 3, roads = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,4]], p = 1
// Output: 2
